    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Set up API Key:**
    Get an Unsplash Access Key from the [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers) site. Then, create a `config.js` file in the project root and add your key like this:
    ```javascript
    // config.js
    const UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY = 'YOUR_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY';
    ```

3.  **Run the App:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## üöÄ Deploying to GitHub Pages

This project is ready for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

1.  **Add API Key to Secrets**: In your GitHub repository, go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`. Create a new secret named `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` and paste your Unsplash key.
2.  **Configure Pages Source**: In `Settings` > `Pages`, set the deployment `Source` to **`GitHub Actions`**.

That's it! Now, every time you push to the `main` branch, your project will be automatically deployed.
